//
// This file defines which actions there are, what description they have and
// some behaviour options. The Doom Builder core will bind to these actions
// with delegates (function pointers) where you use the BeginAction and
// EndAction attributes. This file must be named Actions.cfg and must be
// included in the plugin project as "Embedded Resource".
//

//
// Options:
//
// allowkeys:       Allows the user to bind standard keys to this action.
// allowmouse:      Allows the user to bind mouse buttons to this action.
// allowscroll:     Allows the user to bind the scrollwheel to this action.
// disregardshift:  This action will trigger regardless if Shift or Control is used.
// repeat:          BeginAction will be called for automatic key repetition.
// default:         Default key is only used when the action is loaded for the first
//                  time and the default key is not used by any other action.
//
// allowkeys and allowmouse are true by default, the others are false by default.
